excerpt: "(*please select photos to view more*)<br/><br/>**Analyzing Cardiac Medical Devices with a Machine Learning Method**<br/>My PhD dissertation topic involved analyzing adverse cardiac medical device events from the FDA's MAUDE database. Focusing on years 1997 through 2017, textual data was analyzed with machine learning methods to examine the effects of specific failures on patients. The purpose of this project was to create awareness regarding cardiac medical devices-creating a standard in research, to promote information sharing and knowledge transfer, as well as informing the general public. <br/><a href='/portfolio/cardiac_presentation_github.html'><img src='/images/heart_500_300.jpg'>"
