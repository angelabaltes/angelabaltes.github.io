Hi!
=======
Hello and welcome! As you know my name is Angela Baltes and I am a data professional and an all around nice person :)

I wanted to finally contribute to the data science community by sharing some of my ideas, thoughts and neat projects that I may be working on. I have had several iterations of websites, as I just could not decide on what worked best for not only showcasing my work, but integrating a blog and cv. So, here it is, and here you are!

The field of data science is constantly evolving, which can be intimidating for those looking to enter the field. Fear not, for we are all doing our best to keep up. Stay tuned for more posts.
