Hi, my name is Angela Baltes.

I am a Data Scientist and Informaticist with the University of New Mexico in the [Office of Institutional Analytics](http://oia.unm.edu). Our collaborative research team develops empowering and informative data-driven solutions. 

Before my current role with the University of New Mexico, I have primarily worked in health-focused environments providing data expertise to improve patient outcomes. My latest health project involved the identification of rural communities in New Mexico that are susceptible to disease, and provide alternatives to emergency department usage. My background in analysis led me to graduate from Rutgers University with a PhD in Biomedical Informatics. My doctoral research involved analysis of cardiovascular medical device failures and their effects on patients.  

I am truly passionate and curious about all things data, and spend my time studying and tinkering with datasets I find interesting. My [portfolio](portfolio.html) is filled with projects completed on my own time. My goal as a professional is to provide valuable information that will help others. 

Please feel free to look around and reach out to me!
