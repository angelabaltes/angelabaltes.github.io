Hi, my name is Angela Baltes.

I am a Senior Research Analyst with American Public Education Inc. in the Office of Strategic Analytics and Research. Our collaborative team develops empowering and informative data-driven solutions. 

Before my current role with American Public Education, I have primarily worked in health-focused environments providing data expertise to improve patient outcomes. My latest health project identified rural communities in New Mexico that are susceptible to communicable diseases, and provide alternatives to emergency department usage. My background in analysis led me to graduate from Rutgers University with a PhD in Biomedical Informatics. My doctoral research involved analysis of cardiovascular medical device failures and their effects on patients.  

I am truly passionate and curious about all things data, and spend my time studying and tinkering with datasets I find interesting. My [portfolio](portfolio.html) is filled with projects completed on my own time. My goal as a professional is to provide valuable information that will help others. 

Please feel free to look around and reach out to me!
