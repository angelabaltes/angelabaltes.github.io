Hi, my name is Angela Baltes.

I am a Biomedical Informatics PhD candidate with [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu).

My research with Rutgers University involves analysis of cardiovascular medical device failures and their effects on patients. My advisement committee consists of: [Dr. Frederick Coffman](https://apps.shp.rutgers.edu/projects/facultyLocator/profile1.cfm?RUID=coffmafd), [Dr. Shankar Srinivasan](https://apps.shp.rutgers.edu/projects/facultyLocator/profile1.cfm?RUID=srinivsh), and [Dr. Memory Ndanga](https://apps.shp.rutgers.edu/projects/facultyLocator/profile1.cfm?RUID=ndangame). I am employed by The University of New Mexico in the [Office of Institutional Analytics](http://oia.unm.edu) where our collaborative research team develops empowering and informative data driven solutions. I am also a proud alum of this university, so the work that we perform is deeply meaningful to me.

Before my current role, I have worked primarily in health-focused environments providing data expertise to improve patient outcomes. My latest health project involved the identification of rural communities in New Mexico that are susceptible to disease, and provide alternatives to emergency department usage. 

I am truly passionate and curious about all things data, and spend my time studying and tinkering with datasets I find interesting. My [portfolio](portfolio.html) is filled with projects completed on my own time. My goal as a professional is to provide valuable information that will help others. 

Please feel to look around and reach out to me.
