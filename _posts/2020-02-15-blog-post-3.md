## Received this in the mail on Valentine's Day!

Yesterday was Valentine's Day so receiving this model was so fitting. I am planning to incorporate visual models such as this magnetic heart as well as 4-piece artery model. Basically, this is your artery and this is your artery with plaque!
I plan to walk through the basic structure of the heart and then proceed to talk about heart disease. At that point, I will introduce why cardiac devices are necessary leading into device adverse events.
Have a most wonderful weekend!
