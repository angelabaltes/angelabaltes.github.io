On July 8th, 2020, I successfully defended my dissertation! I am now Angela Baltes, PhD! The actual defense went incredibly well, and I think that is in part due to my upfront work put into the paper beforehand. 
Once submitted to the dean, there were only minor changes that needed to be made. At this point, I believe that I order copies of the dissertation. 
I am not sure what else to say other than four years of hard work has paid off!
