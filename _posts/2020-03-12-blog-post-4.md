## I have completed my first in-person Data Science Bootcamp!

The opportunity to participate in Data Science Dojo's 3 day bootcamp was a simple decision as I have been a consumer of bootcamps for several years and have found my success varies with them. 
I wanted to experience an in-person immersive bootcamp.
