Hello, my name is Angela and welcome to my portfolio. I am a Data Scientist and Biomedical Informatics PhD candidate with Rutgers University under the advisement of Dr. Frederick Coffman, Dr. Shankar Srinivasan and Dr. Memory Ndanga. This is a collection of projects that I am working on from a variety of disciplines and fields for academic and hobby purposes. 

*Note: Data used in projects are for demonstration purposes and derive from publicly accessible sources. 


# Projects

### Crime Analysis
Supervised Learning: Police Incidents within various census tracts in Albuquerque, New Mexico were predicted based upon factors such as median age and income using supervised learning and statistical approaches. This analysis can be beneficial for law enforcement to gauge where to potentially expect calls to originate from.

### Customer Segmentation
Unsupervised Learning: This project analyzed customer spending using unsupervised learning techniques for further insight about customer base. This analysis would be useful in understanding the needs of customers and applying resources to meet their needs in a more prompt manner. 

---

### Finding Donors
Supervised Learning: A model was designed to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually to identify potential donors for an organization. This type of analysis would be useful for non-profits or organizations that rely on donations as a source of revenue.

### Data Wrangling
A mini-project to clean and normalize U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data and merged with a data obtained from The Indian Health Service. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate data wrangling (data pre-processing) that is typical before analysis.

### Poverty 2017
This project provided a visualization of poverty in The United States by state and county for year 2017. The purpose of this is to demonstrate how to communicate results in a visual format to be easily understood by a wider range of audiences.
